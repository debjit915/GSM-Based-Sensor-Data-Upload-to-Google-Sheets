       Project: GSM-Based Sensor Data Upload to Google Sheets

         Overview

This project is designed to read sensor data from a soil moisture sensor, obtain the device's geographical location, and upload this information to a Google Sheet using a GSM module (SIM900A). The project utilizes the TinyGSM library to manage the GSM module and manually handles HTTP requests to interact with a web service.

         Hardware Requirements

1. ESP32 Development Board
2. SIM900A GSM Module
3. Soil Moisture Sensor
4. Jumper Wires
5. Breadboard (optional)

         Software Requirements

1. Arduino IDE
2. TinyGSM Library
3. ArduinoJson Library

         Connections

-   SIM900A GSM Module  :
  - `TX` to ESP32 `RX` (pin 16)
  - `RX` to ESP32 `TX` (pin 17)
  - `GND` to ESP32 `GND`
  - `VCC` to 5V Power Supply
-   Soil Moisture Sensor  :
  - `Analog Output` to ESP32 Analog Pin (pin 34)
  - `VCC` to 3.3V Power Supply
  - `GND` to ESP32 `GND`










       Function Descriptions

1. setup():
   - Initializes serial communication for monitoring and the GSM module.
   - Configures the soil moisture sensor.
   - Restarts and configures the GSM modem.
   - Connects to the GSM network and GPRS service.

2.   loop()  :
   - Monitors the serial input for data to upload.
   - Reads soil moisture data and obtains geographical location.
   - Uploads data to the specified Google Sheets script endpoint.

3.   getLocation()  :
   - Connects to `ip-api.com` to get the geographical location.
   - Parses the JSON response to extract city, region, country, latitude, and longitude.

4.   uploadDataToServer()  :
   - Connects to the specified Google Sheets script endpoint.
   - Sends a POST request with the data to be uploaded.
